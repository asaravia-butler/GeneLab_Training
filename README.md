## About
The [NASA GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) Data Processing team and [Educational Working Group]() members have created training modules designed to teach high school and undergraduate students how to process genetic and gene expression (aka “omics”) data using [GeneLab's standard pipelines](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). This repository contains space biology and bioinformatics lectures and hands-on instruction used during [GeneLab for High Schools (GL4HS)](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/genelab-for-high-schools) and [GeneLab for Colleges and Universities (GL4U)]() training programs. Each subdirectory in this repository holds training material for high school and undergraduate education levels for the omics data types hosted on the [GeneLab Data Repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).

## Usage
We encourage students and educators interested in learning and/or teaching bioinformatics to utilize the resources contained in this repository. Although the enclosed modules are designed to analyze and interpret space-relevant omics data, the materials and pipelines presented can be applied to omics data in all life science fields.

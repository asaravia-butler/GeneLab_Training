# Introduction to Unix and R Using Jupyter Notebooks (JNs)

The JNs in this directory contain instructions and commands for running basic Unix and R commands that are commonly used when processing RNA sequence data. To run these JNs successfully, the JNs and respective input files listed below must be in each bootcamp participant's /home directory on the cluster running the JupyterHub (or in the directory that is linked with the user's account when accessing the JupyterHub web interface, https://domain/jupyter/). The pilot GL4U: RNAseq bootcamp introductory JNs were run on the San Jose State University (SJSU) cluster. Completed introductory JNs in html format can be found in the [Example_Intro_JNs](Example_Intro_JNs) subdirectory.

# Generate the Main Set of Processed RNAseq Data

Prior to running the bootcamp, instructors must select a RNAseq dataset from the [GeneLab Data Repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) and generate processed data using the [GeneLab RNAseq standard processing pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq). These data will be used as input when running the []() that will be used during the bootcamp
